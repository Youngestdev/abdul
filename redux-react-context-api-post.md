TL;DR: React's context API isn't a new thing in the React's ecosystem but React 16.3.0's improvement on the Context API is overwhelming such that it reduces/overthrows the need for Redux/Advanced state management libraries in small scale apps.
In this article, we'll be looking at how the new React Context API replaces the need for Redux by building a small app.
# What's Redux ?
Redux is a javascript library used for state management in popular javascript libraries such as **React** and **Angular** whereas *state management* simply means handling changes that occur upon running / executing a particular task.

> Note that state management can be performed locally using React's **setState** but is limited to small / byte-sized apps.
